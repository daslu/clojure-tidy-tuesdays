# Holiday Movies

There are two datasets in here, one of holiday movies, one with the holiday movie genres. They're generated using the code in `generate_dataset.clj`, which is mostly a "translation" into Clojure of the [cleaning script](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2023/2023-12-12#cleaning-script) provided in the R4DS tidy tuesday repo, with some additional explanations.
