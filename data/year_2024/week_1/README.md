# Holiday Movies

There are two datasets in here, one of holiday movies, one with the holiday movie genres. They're generated using the code in [`generate_dataset.clj`](src/year_2024/week_1/generate_dataset.clj), which is mostly a "translation" into Clojure of the [cleaning script](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2023/2023-12-12#cleaning-script) provided in the R4DS tidy tuesday repo, with some additional explanations. More information about the data can be found in the [README for this data](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-12-12/readme.md) in the R4DS TidyTuesday repo.
