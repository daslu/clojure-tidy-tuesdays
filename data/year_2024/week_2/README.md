# Canadian Hockey Player Birth Months

This is a fun one. In this folder are datasets about the birth months of NHL hockey players. They're generated using the code in [`generate_dataset.clj`](generate_dataset.clj), which is mostly a "translation" into Clojure of the [cleaning script](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2024/2024-01-09#cleaning-script) provided in the R4DS tidy tuesday repo, with some additional explanations. More information about this data can be found in the [README for this data](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2024/2024-01-09) in the R4DS TidyTuesday repo.
